Pride and Prejudice and Python
==============================

A Jupyter notebook that uses n-grams and Markov chains to create Austen like
prose. Includes a running commentary to explain WTF is going on in the code, so
beginner programmers get to see the movement of thought used to solve the
problem as the code unfolds. Enjoy..! :-)

    more moderate! It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night
    out of two. When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the success she expected.
